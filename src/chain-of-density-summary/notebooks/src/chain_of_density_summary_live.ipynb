    "make and model of your car\n",
    "serial number of your car\n",

It may also help cover additional living expenses if you\\'re temporarily unable to live in your home. These may include living in a hotel or renting a home.\\n\\nYour home insurance may cover:\\n\\ndamage or loss to your home\\ndamage, theft or loss of your personal possessions\\npersonal property stolen from your vehicle\\ndamage or injury to others who visit your home or property\\naccidental damage you cause to somebody else’s property\\nInsurance companies may refer to home insurance as property and casualty insurance. Property and casualty insurance also includes car insurance, business insurance and disaster insurance.\\n\\nWho your home insurance policy covers\\nGenerally, your home insurance policy covers you and your family members.\\n\\nIf you share your home or if you rent a part of it, you must inform your insurance company.\\n\\nCheck with your insurance company, agent or broker to review who your policy covers.\\n\\nCondominium insurance\\nCondominium (condo) insurance is different from home insurance. It covers damage or loss to the inside of your condo and your storage locker. It also covers personal liability claims for someone injured in your condo.\\n\\nYour condo corporation has an insurance policy that covers the outside structure of the building and its common areas.\\n\\nCondo insurance may pay for:\\n\\ndamage to the inside structure of your condo\\ndamage to, or loss of, your belongings\\ndamage to improvements you, or the previous owners, made to your condo\\ndamage to other condos or common areas caused by an accident in your condo\\nadditional living expenses, up to a certain amount. For example, if you\\'re temporarily unable to live in your condo because of a loss covered by your policy\\nReview your condo insurance policy coverage and your condo’s corporation insurance policy coverage.\\n\\nTenant’s insurance\\nYou may want to consider buying tenant’s insurance if you live in an apartment or rent a home. Insurance companies may refer to it as renter’s insurance.\\n\\nYou should have enough insurance to cover the cost of replacing everything in your home.\\n\\nTenant’s insurance may pay for:\\n\\ndamage to or loss of your possessions if you rent or lease your apartment or home from someone else\\npersonal property stolen from your vehicle\\naccidental damage you cause to any part of the apartment building or home you\\'re renting\\ninjury to visitors\\nadditional living expenses, within a certain limit. For example, if you\\'re temporarily unable to live in your apartment because of a loss covered by your policy\\nInsurance for a home-based business\\nConsider getting business insurance if you have a home-based business.\\n\\nHome insurance isn\\'t business insurance. If you have a home-based business, you must notify your insurer. Using your home for purposes that your insurer isn\\'t aware of may cancel your policy.\\n\\nHome insurance generally won\\'t cover claims related to your home-based business. Your home insurance policy may provide limited coverage for damage or loss of business equipment. This coverage is only for the business equipment that is in your home. Business equipment may include computers and power tools. The limited coverage may not be enough to cover the cost of repairing or replacing your business equipment.\\n\\nHome insurance won\\'t cover:\\n\\nequipment that is damaged while in your home, if used for business purposes\\nstolen or damaged equipment while in your vehicle or outside of your home\\nstolen or damaged tools while in your vehicle or outside of your home\\ninjury to a client while visiting your home, also known as personal liability\\nReview your home insurance policy to confirm what coverage, if any, it will provide for a home-based business.\\n\\nLearn more about the types of business insurance coverage.\\n\\nHome insurance coverage\\nMake sure you understand what your home insurance covers. You should also understand what types of settlement to expect if you make a claim. Speak with your licensed insurance agent or registered insurance broker.\\n\\nTypes of home insurance coverage\\nCoverage is the maximum amount of money your insurance company will pay you if you make a claim.\\n\\nFor home insurance, you may need a combination of 2 types of coverage: personal property coverage and liability coverage.\\n\\nPersonal property coverage\\nPersonal property coverage protects you from loss or damage to:\\n\\nyour home or personal possessions\\nyour car\\nTo figure out how much coverage you need, make a list of all your possessions with the following information:\\n\\ncost to replace the item (replacement value)\\nmake and model of your car\\nserial number of your car\\npictures of your belongings\\nreceipts for major items\\nThis list might be useful if you need to make an insurance claim in the future.\\n\\nLiability coverage\\nLiability coverage protects you against legal liability for losses caused by:\\n\\ninjury to other people\\ndamage to the property of others\\nRead your policy carefully before signing. Make sure you understand what your policy does and doesn’t cover.\\n\\nAsk your insurance agent or broker about anything you don\\'t understand.\\n\\nLearn more about the types of home insurance coverage.\\n\\nWhat your home insurance policy doesn’t cover\\nHome insurance doesn’t cover predictable events and certain types of unexpected events.\\n\\nUnexpected events\\nYour home insurance may cover certain types of unexpected events or accidents such as fire, windstorm, or theft.

A loss payee clause makes your mortgage lender your beneficiary. In case of loss or damage to your home, your insurance company will pay your lender (your beneficiary). They’ll pay up to the balance of your mortgage when you submit a claim.\\n\\nWhen you make a claim, your insurance company may, at their discretion, give the money to either:\\n\\nyou, so you can fix your home when you submit a claim\\nyour lender, who would then give you the money for repairs or replacement after you submit receipts as proof\\n\\n\\nYou will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above Article.\\n\\nRepeat the following 2 steps 5 times.\\n\\nStep 1. Identify 1-3 informative Entities (\";\" delimited) from the Article which are missing from the previously generated summary.\\nStep 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the Missing Entities.\\n\\nA Missing Entity is:\\n- Relevant: to the main story.\\n- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).\\n- Novel: not in the previous summary.\\n- Faithful: present in the Article.\\n- Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, —80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., \"this article discusses\") to reach ~80 words.\\n- Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\\n- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\".\\n- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.\\n- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.\\n- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.\\n\\nRemember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.\\n\\nAnswer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length 5) of dictionaries whose keys are \"Missing Entities\" and \"Denser Summary\".\\n'"
